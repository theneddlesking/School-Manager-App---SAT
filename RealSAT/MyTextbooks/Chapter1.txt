Objectives
In this chapter we introduce the notation that will be used throughout the rest of the book.
You will have met much of it before and this will serve as revision. The language introduced
in this chapter helps to express important mathematical ideas precisely. Initially they may
seem unnecessarily abstract, but later in the book you will find them used more and more in
practical situations.
In Chapters 2 to 8 we will study different families of functions. In Chapter 2 we will revise
linear functions, in Chapter 4, polynomial functions in general and in Chapters 5 and 6,
exponential, logarithmic and circular functions.

1A Set notation and sets of numbers
 Set notation
Set notation is used widely in mathematics and in this book where appropriate. This section
summarises all of the set notation you will need.
 A set is a collection of objects. The objects that are in the set are known as elements or
members of the set.
 If x is an element of a set A, we write x ∈ A. This can also be read as ‘x is a member of the
set A’ or ‘x belongs to A’ or ‘x is in A’.
 If x is not an element of A, we write x  A.
 A set B is called a subset of a set A if every element of B
is also an element of A. We write B ⊆ A. This expression
can also be read as ‘B is contained in A’ or ‘A contains B’.
For example, let B = {0, 1, 2} and A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. Then
3 ∈ A, 3  B and B ⊆ A
as illustrated in the Venn diagram opposite.

3 B
A
 The set of elements common to two sets A and B is called the intersection of A and B, and
is denoted by A ∩ B. Thus x ∈ A ∩ B if and only if x ∈ A and x ∈ B.
 If the sets A and B have no elements in common, we say A and B are disjoint, and write
A ∩ B = ∅. The set ∅ is called the empty set.
 The set of elements that are in A or in B (or in both) is called the union of sets A and B,
and is denoted by A ∪ B.
For example, let A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The intersection and union are
illustrated by the Venn diagram shown opposite:
A ∩ B = {1, 3, 5}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}

For A = {1, 2, 3, 7} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, find:

Example 1
Solution Explanation
a A ∩ B = {3, 7} The elements 3 and 7 are common to sets A and B.
b A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} The set A ∪ B contains all elements that belong to A
or B (or both).

1A Set notation and sets of numbers 3
The set difference of two sets A and B is given by
A \ B = { x : x ∈ A, x < B }
The set A \ B contains the elements of A that are not elements of B.
For A = {1, 2, 3, 7} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, find:
a A \ B b B \ A
Example 2
Solution Explanation
a A \ B = {1, 2, 3, 7} \ {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
= {1, 2}
The elements 1 and 2 are in A but not in B.
b B \ A = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} \ {1, 2, 3, 7}
= {4, 5, 6}
The elements 4, 5 and 6 are in B but not in A.
I Sets of numbers
We begin by recalling that the elements of {1, 2, 3, 4, . . . } are called the natural numbers,
and the elements of { . . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . } are called integers.
The numbers of the form p
q
, with p and q integers, q , 0, are called rational numbers.
The real numbers which are not rational are called irrational (e.g. π and √
2).
The rationals may be characterised as being those real numbers that can be written as a
terminating or recurring decimal.
 The set of real numbers will be denoted by R.
 The set of rational numbers will be denoted by Q.
 The set of integers will be denoted by Z.
 The set of natural numbers will be denoted by N.
It is clear that N ⊆ Z ⊆ Q ⊆ R, and this may be
represented by the diagram on the right.
Describing a set
It is not always possible to list the elements of
a set. There is an alternative way of describing
sets that is especially useful for infinite sets.
N Z RQ
The set of all x such that is denoted by { x : }. Thus, for example:
 { x : 0 < x < 1 } is the set of all real numbers strictly between 0 and 1
 { x : x ≥ 3 } is the set of all real numbers greater than or equal to 3
 { x : x > 0, x ∈ Q } is the set of all positive rational numbers
 { 2n : n = 0, 1, 2, . . . } is the set of all non-negative even numbers
 { 2n + 1 : n = 0, 1, 2, . . . } is the set of all non-negative odd numbers.

Interval notation
Among the most important subsets of R are the intervals. The following is an exhaustive list
of the various types of intervals and the standard notation for them. We suppose that a and b
are real numbers with a < b.
(a, b) = { x : a < x < b } [a, b] = { x : a ≤ x ≤ b }
(a, b] = { x : a < x ≤ b } [a, b) = { x : a ≤ x < b }
(a, ∞) = { x : a < x } [a, ∞) = { x : a ≤ x }
(−∞, b) = { x : x < b } (−∞, b] = { x : x ≤ b }
Intervals may be represented by diagrams as shown in Example 3.
Illustrate each of the following intervals of real numbers:
a [−2, 3] b (−3, 4] c (−∞, 5] d (−2, 4) e (−3, ∞)

Notes:
 The ‘closed’ circle (•) indicates that the number is included.
 The ‘open’ circle (◦) indicates that the number is not included.
The following are subsets of the real numbers for which we have special notation:
 Positive real numbers: R+ = { x : x > 0 }
 Negative real numbers: R− = { x : x < 0 }
 Real numbers excluding zero: R \ {0}
Section summary
 If x is an element of a set A, we write x ∈ A.
 If x is not an element of a set A, we write x  A.
 If every element of B is an element of A, we say B is a subset of A and write B ⊆ A.
 The set A ∩ B is the intersection of A and B, where x ∈ A ∩ B if and only if x ∈ A
and x ∈ B.
 The set A ∪ B is the union of A and B, where x ∈ A ∪ B if and only if x ∈ A or x ∈ B.

1B Identifying and describing relations and functions
 Relations, domain and range
An ordered pair, denoted (x, y), is a pair of elements x and y in which x is considered to be
the first coordinate and y the second coordinate.
A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The following are examples of relations:
a S = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)}
b T = {(−3, 5), (4, 12), (5, 12), (7, −6)}
Every relation determines two sets:
 The set of all the first coordinates of the ordered pairs is called the domain.
 The set of all the second coordinates of the ordered pairs is called the range.
For the above examples:
a domain of S = {1, 3, 5}, range of S = {1, 2, 4, 6}
b domain of T = {−3, 4, 5, 7}, range of T = {5, 12, −6}
Some relations may be defined by a rule relating the elements in the domain to their
corresponding elements in the range. In order to define the relation fully, we need to specify
both the rule and the domain. For example, the set

(x, y) : y = x + 1, x ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}

is the relation
{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)}
The domain is the set X = {1, 2, 3, 4} and the range is the set Y = {2, 3, 4, 5}.

1B Identifying and describing relations and functions 7
When the domain of a relation is not explicitly stated, it is understood to consist of all real
numbers for which the defining rule has meaning. For example:
 S = { (x, y) : y = x2 } is assumed to have domain R
 T = { (x, y) : y = √x } is assumed to have domain [0, ∞).
Sketch the graph of each of the following relations and state the domain and range of each:
a { (x, y) : y = x2 } b { (x, y) : y ≤ x + 1 }
c {(−2, −1), (−1, −1), (−1, 1), (0, 1), (1, −1)} d { (x, y) : x2 + y2 = 1 }
e { (x, y):2x + 3y = 6, x ≥ 0 } f { (x, y) : y = 2x − 1, x ∈ [−1, 2]}

8 Chapter 1: Functions and relations
Sometimes set notation is not used in the specification of a relation.
For the previous example:
a is written as y = x2
b is written as y ≤ x + 1
e is written as 2x + 3y = 6, x ≥ 0
 Functions
A function is a relation such that for each x-value there is only one corresponding y-value.
This means that, if (a, b) and (a, c) are ordered pairs of a function, then b = c. In other words,
a function cannot contain two different ordered pairs with the same first coordinate.
Which of the following sets of ordered pairs defines a function?
a S = {(−3, −4), (−1, −1), (−6, 7), (1, 5)} b T = {(−4, 1), (−4, −1), (−6, 7), (−6, 8)}
Example 5
Solution
S is a function because for each x-value
there is only one y-value.
a T is not a function, because there is an
x-value with two different y-values: the
two ordered pairs (−4, 1) and (−4, −1)
in T have the same first coordinate.
b
One way to identify whether a relation is a function is to draw a graph of the relation and then
apply the following test.
Vertical-line test
If a vertical line can be drawn anywhere on the graph and it only ever intersects the graph
a maximum of once, then the relation is a function.
For example:
x O
y
x O
y
x2 + y2 = 1 is not a function y = x2 is a function
Functions are usually denoted by lowercase letters such as f , g, h.

1B Identifying and describing relations and functions 9
The definition of a function tells us that, for each x in the domain of f , there is a unique
element y in the range such that (x, y) ∈ f . The element y is called ‘the image of x under f’
or ‘the value of f at x’, and the element x is called ‘a pre-image of y’.
For (x, y) ∈ f , the element y is determined by x, and so we also use the notation f(x), read as
‘f of x’, in place of y.
This gives an alternative way of writing functions:
 For the function { (x, y) : y = x2 }, write f : R → R, f(x) = x2.
 For the function { (x, y) : y = 2x − 1, x ∈ [0, 4]}, write f : [0, 4] → R, f(x) = 2x − 1.
 For the function 
(x, y) : y = 1
x

, write f : R \ {0} → R, f(x) = 1
x
.
If the domain is R, we often just write the rule: for example, f(x) = x2.
Note that in using the notation f : X → Y, the set X is the domain, but Y is not necessarily the
range. It is a set that contains the range and is called the codomain. With this notation for
functions, the domain of f is written as dom f and range of f as ran f.

h

h(x)
f(x) = x2, x ∈ R g(x) = x2, −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 h(x) = x2, x ∈ R+ ∪ {0}
The different letters, f , g and h, used to name the functions emphasise the fact that there
are three different functions, even though they each have the same rule. They are different
because they are defined for different domains.
We call g and h restrictions of f , since their domains are subsets of the domain of f .

1B 1B Identifying and describing relations and functions 13
Section summary
 An ordered pair, denoted (x, y), is a pair of elements x and y in which x is considered
to be the first coordinate and y the second coordinate.
 A relation is a set of ordered pairs.
• The set of all the first coordinates of the ordered pairs is called the domain.
• The set of all the second coordinates of the ordered pairs is called the range.
 Some relations may be defined by a rule relating the elements in the domain to their
corresponding elements in the range: for example, 
(x, y) : y = x + 1, x ∈ R+ ∪ {0}

.
 A function is a relation such that for each x-value there is only one corresponding
y-value.
 Vertical-line test: If a vertical line can be drawn anywhere on the graph and it only
ever intersects the graph a maximum of once, then the relation is a function.
 For an ordered pair (x, y) of a function f , we say that y is the image of x under f or
that y is the value of f at x, and we say that x is a pre-image of y. Since the y-value is
determined by the x-value, we use the notation f(x), read as ‘f of x’, in place of y.
 Notation for defining functions: For example, we write f : [0, 4] → R, f(x) = 2x − 1 to
define a function f with domain [0, 4] and rule f(x) = 2x − 1.
 A restriction of a function has the same rule but a ‘smaller’ domain.

I One-to-one functions
A function is said to be one-to-one if different x-values map to different y-values. That is, a
function f is one-to-one if a , b implies f(a) , f(b), for all a, b ∈ dom f .
An equivalent way to say this is that a function f is one-to-one if f(a) = f(b) implies a = b,
for all a, b ∈ dom f .
The function f(x) = 2x + 1 is one-to-one because
f(a) = f(b) ⇒ 2a + 1 = 2b + 1
⇒ 2a = 2b
⇒ a = b
The function f(x) = x
2
is not one-to-one as, for example, f(3) = 9 = f(−3).

a f = {(2, −3), (4, 7), (6, 6), (8, 10)} b g = {(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 7)}
Example 10
Solution
The function f is one-to-one as the
second coordinates of all of the ordered
pairs are different.
a The function g is not one-to-one as the
second coordinates of the ordered pairs
are not all different: g(1) = 4 = g(3).
b
The vertical-line test can be used to determine whether a relation is a function or not.
Similarly, there is a geometric test that determines whether a function is one-to-one or not.
Horizontal-line test
If a horizontal line can be drawn anywhere on the graph of a function and it only ever
intersects the graph a maximum of once, then the function is one-to-one.

1C Types of functions and implied domains 17
A function that is not one-to-one is many-to-one.
 Implied domains
If the domain of a function is not specified, then the domain is the largest subset of R for
which the rule is defined; this is called the implied domain or the maximal domain.
Thus, for the function f(x) = √x, the implied domain is [0, ∞). We write:
f : [0, ∞) → R, f(x) = √
x
Find the implied domain and the corresponding range for the functions with rules:
a f(x) = 2x − 3 f(x) = 1
(x − 2)2 b f(x) = √ c x + 6 f(x) = √
4 − x d 2
Example 12
Solution
a f(x) = 2x − 3 is defined for all x. The implied domain is R. The range is R.
b f(x) = 1
(x − 2)2 is defined for x  2. The implied domain is R \ {2}. The range is R+.
c f(x) = √
x + 6 is defined for x + 6 ≥ 0, i.e. for x ≥ −6.
Thus the implied domain is [−6, ∞). The range is R+ ∪ {0}.
d f(x) = √
4 − x2 is defined for 4 − x2 ≥ 0, i.e. for x2 ≤ 4.
Thus the implied domain is [−2, 2]. The range is [0, 2].
Find the implied domain of the functions with the following rules:
f(x) = 2
2x − 3 a g(x) = √ b 5 − x
h(x) = √
x − 5 + √ c 8 − x f(x) = √
x d 2 − 7x + 12
Example 13
Solution
a f(x) is defined when 2x − 3  0, i.e. when x  3
2 . Thus the implied domain is R \ { 3
2 }.
b g(x) is defined when 5 − x ≥ 0, i.e. when x ≤ 5. Thus the implied domain is (−∞, 5].
c h(x) is defined when x − 5 ≥ 0 and 8 − x ≥ 0, i.e. when x ≥ 5 and x ≤ 8. Thus the
implied domain is [5, 8].
d f(x) is defined when
x2 − 7x + 12 ≥ 0
which is equivalent to
(x − 3)(x − 4) ≥ 0
Thus f(x) is defined when x ≥ 4 or x ≤ 3.
The implied domain is (−∞, 3] ∪ [4, ∞).

 Odd and even functions
Odd functions
An odd function has the property that f(−x) = −f(x). The graph of an odd function has
rotational symmetry with respect to the origin: the graph remains unchanged after rotation of
180◦ about the origin.
For example, f(x) = x3 − x is an
odd function, since
f(−x) = (−x)
3 − (−x)
= −x3 + x
= −f(x) −1
x O 1
y
−1 O 1 x
y
y = f(x) y = f(−x)
Even functions
An even function has the property that f(−x) = f(x). The
graph of an even function is symmetrical about the y-axis.
For example, f(x) = x2 − 1 is an even function, since
f(−x) = (−x)
2 − 1
= x2 − 1
= f(x) −1
x
y = x2 − 1

The properties of odd and even functions often facilitate the sketching of graphs.

Section summary
 A function f is one-to-one if different x-values map to different y-values. Equivalently,
a function f is one-to-one if f(a) = f(b) implies a = b, for all a, b ∈ dom f .
 Horizontal-line test: If a horizontal line can be drawn anywhere on the graph of a
function and it only ever intersects the graph a maximum of once, then the function is
one-to-one.
 When the domain of a function is not explicitly stated, it is assumed to consist of all
real numbers for which the rule has meaning; this is called the implied domain or the
maximal domain of the function.
 Functions which have different rules for different subsets of their domain are called
piecewise-defined functions.
 A function f is odd if f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in the domain of f .
 A function f is even if f(−x) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f .

1D Sums and products of functions
The domain of f is denoted by dom f and the domain of g by dom g. Let f and g be
functions such that dom f ∩ dom g  ∅. The sum, f + g, and the product, f g, as functions
on dom f ∩ dom g are defined by
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) and (f g)(x) = f(x) g(x)
The domain of both f + g and f g is the intersection of the domains of f and g, i.e. the values
of x for which both f and g are defined.
If f(x) = √

 Addition of ordinates
We have seen that, for two functions f and g, a new function f + g can be defined by
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
dom(f + g) = dom f ∩ dom g
We now look at how to graph the new function f + g. This is a useful graphing technique and
can be combined with other techniques such as finding axis intercepts, stationary points and
asymptotes.
Sketch the graphs of f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = 3 − 2x and hence the graph of (f + g)(x).
Example 17
Solution
For f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = 3 − 2x, we have
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
= (x + 1) + (3 − 2x)
= 4 − x
For example:
(f + g)(2) = f(2) + g(2)
= 3 + (−1) = 2
i.e. the ordinates are added.

 Addition of ordinates This technique can be used to help sketch the graph of the
sum of two functions. Key points to consider when sketching y = (f + g)(x):
• When f(x) = 0, (f + g)(x) = g(x).
• When g(x) = 0, (f + g)(x) = f(x).
• If f(x) and g(x) are positive, then (f + g)(x) > g(x) and (f + g)(x) > f(x).
• If f(x) and g(x) are negative, then (f + g)(x) < g(x) and (f + g)(x) < f(x).
• If f(x) is positive and g(x) is negative, then g(x) < (f + g)(x) < f(x).
• Look for values of x for which f(x) + g(x) = 0.

1E Composite functions
A function may be considered to be similar to a
machine for which the input (domain) is processed
to produce an output (range). For example, the
diagram on the right represents an ‘f-machine’
where f(x) = 3x + 2.
INPUT
11
3
OUTPUT
f(3) = 3 × 3 + 2 = 11
f-machine
With many processes, more than one machine operation is required to produce an output.
Suppose an output is the result of one
function being applied after another.
For example: f(x) = 3x + 2
g(x) = x2 followed by
This is illustrated on the right.
A new function h is formed. The rule for
h is h(x) = (3x + 2)2.

OUTPUT
11
3
121
f(3) = 3 × 3 + 2 = 11
g(11) = 112 = 121
f-machine
g-machine
The diagram shows f(3) = 11 and then g(11) = 121. This may be written:
h(3) = g(f(3)) = g(11) = 121
The new function h is said to be the composition of g with f . This is written h = g ◦ f
(read ‘composition of f followed by g’) and the rule for h is given by h(x) = g(f(x)).
In the example we have considered:
h(x) = g(f(x))
= g(3x + 2)
= (3x + 2)2
In general, for functions f and g such that
ran f ⊆ dom g
we define the composite function of g with f by
g ◦ f(x) = g(f(x))
dom(g ◦ f) = dom f

Find both f ◦ g and g ◦ f , stating the domain and range of each, where:
f : R → R, f(x) = 2x − 1 and g: R → R, g(x) = 3x2

To determine the existence of a composite function, it is
useful to form a table of domains and ranges.
We see that f ◦ g is defined since ran g ⊆ dom f , and
that g ◦ f is defined since ran f ⊆ dom g.

For the range of f ∗ to be a subset of R+ ∪ {0}, the
domain of f must be restricted to a subset of

1F Inverse functions
If f is a one-to-one function, then for each number y in the range of f there is exactly one
number x in the domain of f such that f(x) = y.
Thus if f is a one-to-one function, a new function f −1, called the inverse of f , may be
defined by:
f −1
(x) = y if f(y) = x, for x ∈ ran f and y ∈ dom f
Note: The function f −1 is also a one-to one function, and f is the inverse of f −1.
It is not difficult to see what the relation between f and
f −1 means geometrically. The point (x, y) is on the graph
of f −1 if the point (y, x) is on the graph of f . Therefore to
get the graph of f −1 from the graph of f , the graph of f is
to be reflected in the line y = x.
From this the following is evident:

1F Inverse functions 33
A function has an inverse function if and only if it is one-to-one. Using the notation for
composition we can write:
f ◦ f −1
(x) = x, for all x ∈ dom f −1
f −1 ◦ f(x) = x, for all x ∈ dom f
Find the inverse function f −1 of the function f(x) = 2x − 3.
Example 23
Solution
Method 1
The graph of f has equation y = 2x − 3 and
the graph of f −1 has equation x = 2y − 3,
that is, x and y are interchanged.
Solve for y:
x = 2y − 3
x + 3 = 2y
∴ y = 1
2 (x + 3)
Thus f −1(x) = 1
2 (x + 3) and
dom f −1 = ran f = R.
Method 2
We require f −1 such that

dom f −1 = ran f = R.

(x, y) → (y, x). This is read as ‘the ordered pair (x, y) is mapped to the ordered pair (y, x)’.
Reflecting the graph of a function in the line y = x produces the graph of its inverse relation.
Note that the image in the graph below is not a function.

If the function is one-to-one, then the image is the graph of a function. (This is because, if the
function satisfies the horizontal-line test, then its reflection will satisfy the vertical-line test.)

rather than the more complicated equation

Let f be the function given by f(x) = 1
x2 for x ∈ R \ {0}. Define a suitable restriction g
of f such that g−1 exists, and find g−1.
Example 28
Solution
The function f is not one-to-one. Therefore the
inverse function f −1 is not defined. The following
restrictions of f are one-to-one:
f1 : (0, ∞) → R, f1(x) = 1
x2 Range of f1 = (0, ∞)
f2 : (−∞, 0) → R, f2(x) = 1

Section summary
 If f is a one-to-one function, then a new function f −1, called the inverse of f , may be
defined by
f −1
(x) = y if f(y) = x, for x ∈ ran f , y ∈ dom f
 dom f −1 = ran f
 ran f −1 = dom f
 f ◦ f −1(x) = x, for all x ∈ dom f −1
 f −1 ◦ f(x) = x, for all x ∈ dom f
 The point (x, y) is on the graph of f −1 if and only
if the point (y, x) is on the graph of f . Thus the
graph of f −1 is the reflection of the graph of f in the
line y = x.

In this section we look at functions of the form f(x) = xr

 Increasing and decreasing functions
We say a function f is strictly increasing on an interval
if x2 > x1 implies f(x2) > f(x1).
For example:
 The graph opposite shows a strictly increasing function.
 A straight line with positive gradient is strictly increasing.
 The function f : (0, ∞) → R, f(x) = x2 is strictly increasing.

We say a function f is strictly decreasing on an interval
if x2 > x1 implies f(x2) < f(x1).
For example:

 Power functions with positive integer index
We start by considering power functions
f(x) = xn where n is a positive integer.
Taking n = 1, 2, 3, we obtain the linear
function f(x) = x, the quadratic function
f(x) = x2 and the cubic function f(x) = x3.
We have studied these functions in
Mathematical Methods Units 1 & 2 and
have referred to them in the earlier sections
of this chapter.
The general shape of the graph of f(x) = xn
depends on whether the index n is odd
or even.

n where n is a positive integer
Let a be a positive real number and let n ∈ N. Then a

That is, a

n is the positive number whose nth power is a. We can also write this as a

n = √n a.
For example: 9

2 = 3, since 32 = 9.
We define 0

n = 0, for each natural number n, since 0n = 0.
If n is odd, then we can also define a

n when a is negative. If a is negative and n is odd,
define a

We prove the following result in the special case when n = 5. The general proof is similar.
If n is an odd positive integer, then f(x) = xn is strictly increasing for R.
Proof Let f(x) = x5 and let a > b. To show that f(a) > f(b), we consider five cases.
Case 1: a > b > 0 We have
f(a) − f(b) = a5 − b5
= (a − b)(a4 + a3
b + a2
b2 + ab3 + b4
) (Show by expanding.)
Since a > b, we have a − b > 0. Since we are assuming that a and b are positive in this
case, all the terms of a4 + a3b + a2b2 + ab3 + b4 are positive. Therefore f(a) − f(b) > 0
and so f(a) > f(b).
Case 2: a > 0 and b < 0 In this case, we have f(a) = a5 > 0 and f(b) = b5 < 0
(an odd power of a negative number). Thus f(a) > f(b).
Case 3: a = 0 and b < 0 We have f(a) = 0 and f(b) < 0. Thus f(a) > f(b).
Case 4: b = 0 and a > 0 We have f(a) > 0 and f(b) = 0. Thus f(a) > f(b).
Case 5: 0 > a > b Let a = −c and b = −d, where c and d are positive. Then a > b
implies −c > −d and so c < d. Hence f(c) < f(d) by Case 1 and thus f(−a) < f(−b).
But f is an odd function and so −f(a) < −f(b). Finally, we have f(a) > f(b).
Note: For the general proof, use the identity
an − bn = (a − b)(an−1 + an−2b + an−3b2 + ··· + a2bn−3 + abn−2 + bn−1)

48 Chapter 1: Functions and relations
If f is a strictly increasing function on R, then it is a one-to-one function and so has an
inverse. Thus f(x) = x
n has an inverse function, where n is an odd positive integer.
Similar results can be achieved for restrictions of functions with rules f(x) = x
n
, where n is
an even positive integer. For example, g: R
+ ∪ {0} → R, g(x) = x
6
is a strictly increasing
function and h: R
− ∪ {0} → R, h(x) = x
6
is a strictly decreasing function. In both cases, these
restricted functions are one-to-one.
If f is an odd one-to-one function, then f
−1
is also an odd function.
Proof Let x ∈ dom f
−1
and let y = f
−1
(x). Then f(y) = x. Since f is an odd function, we
have f(−y) = −x, which implies that f
−1
(−x) = −y. Hence f
−1
(−x) = −f
−1
(x).
By this result we see that, if n is odd, then f(x) = x
1
n is an odd function. It can also be shown
that, if f is a strictly increasing function, then f
−1
is strictly increasing.

Example 34
Solution
The dimensions of the box will be 24 − 2x, 18 − 2x and x.
Thus the volume of the box is determined by the function
V(x) = (24 − 2x)(18 − 2x)x
For the box to be formed:
24 − 2x ≥ 0 and 18 − 2x ≥ 0 and x ≥ 0
Therefore x ≤ 12 and x ≤ 9 and x ≥ 0. The domain of V is [0, 9].

Chapter summary
Relations

Spreadsheet
AS
Nrich
A relation is a set of ordered pairs.
 The domain is the set of all the first coordinates of the ordered pairs in the relation.
 The range is the set of all the second coordinates of the ordered pairs in the relation.
Functions
 A function is a relation such that no two ordered pairs in the relation have the same first
coordinate.
 For each x in the domain of a function f , there is a unique element y in the range such
that (x, y) ∈ f . The element y is called the image of x under f or the value of f at x and is
denoted by f(x).
 When the domain of a function is not explicitly stated, it is assumed to consist of all
real numbers for which the rule has meaning; this is called the implied domain or the
maximal domain of the function.
 For a function f , the domain is denoted by dom f and the range by ran f.
 Let f and g be functions such that dom f ∩ dom g , ∅. Then the sum, f + g, and the
product, f g, as functions on dom f ∩ dom g are defined by
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) and (f g)(x) = f(x) · g(x)
 The composition of functions f and g is denoted by f ◦ g. The rule is given by
f ◦ g(x) = f(g(x))
The domain of f ◦ g is the domain of g. The composition f ◦ g is defined only if the range
of g is a subset of the domain of f .
One-to-one functions and inverses
 A function f is said to be one-to-one if a , b implies f(a) , f(b), for all a, b ∈ dom f .
 If f is a one-to-one function, then a new function f
−1
, called the inverse of f , may be
defined by
f

Types of functions

 A function f is even if f(−x) = f(x) for all x in the domain of f .
 A function f is strictly increasing on an interval if x2 > x1 implies f(x2) > f(x1).
 A function f is strictly decreasing on an interval if x2 > x1 implies f(x2) < f(x1).
 A power function is a function f with rule f(x) = x
